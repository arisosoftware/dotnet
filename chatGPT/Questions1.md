## ✅ **Top 5 EF Core Interview Questions (Practical)**

**Q1: How do you avoid performance issues like the N+1 query problem in EF Core?**  
**A1:** Use `.Include()` or projection queries with `.Select()` to eagerly load related entities and avoid repeated round-trips to the database.

**Q2: How does EF Core migration work, and how should it be handled in production?**  
**A2:** Use `dotnet ef migrations add` to generate migration files, then `dotnet ef database update` in dev. For production, generate SQL scripts (`dotnet ef migrations script`) and apply them via a DBA.

**Q3: How do you manage transactions across multiple tables in EF Core?**  
**A3:** Use `DbContext.Database.BeginTransaction()` to wrap operations, ensuring atomic commits across entities.

**Q4: How do you handle concurrency conflicts in EF Core?**  
**A4:** Use a `[Timestamp]` property (e.g., `RowVersion`) to detect conflicts. EF throws `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` if the entity was modified elsewhere.

**Q5: What is the difference between `.AsNoTracking()` and `.AsTracking()`?**  
**A5:** `.AsNoTracking()` is for read-only queries and improves performance. `.AsTracking()` is needed when changes to the entity must be saved.

---

## ✅ **Top 6 .NET 8 / C# Interview Questions (Practical)**

**Q1: How do you implement Dependency Injection in .NET 8?**  
**A1:** Register services in `Program.cs` using `builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();`.

**Q2: How do you build a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core?**  
**A2:** Use `[ApiController]`, attribute routing, model validation, Swagger for docs, and middleware for CORS and global exception handling.

**Q3: How do you handle exceptions and logging in production?**  
**A3:** Use `UseExceptionHandler()` middleware and structured logging tools like **Serilog**, **NLog**, or **Application Insights**.

**Q4: How do you manage EF Core database access effectively?**  
**A4:** Avoid lazy loading unless needed, use `.AsNoTracking()` for reads, apply indexing, and batch writes to reduce DB load.

**Q5: How do you support multiple environments in configuration?**  
**A5:** Use config layering (e.g., `appsettings.Development.json`), environment variables, and `IOptions<T>`/`IConfiguration`.

**Q6: How does async/await work and what are pitfalls?**  
**A6:** Compiles to a state machine that resumes after async tasks. Avoid `.Result`/`.Wait()` to prevent deadlocks, especially in UI or ASP.NET contexts.

---

## ✅ **Top 3 ReactJS Interview Questions (Practical)**

**Q1: How do you manage component state and when should you lift it up?**  
**A1:** Use `useState()` for local state. Lift state up when multiple child components need to share or modify it.

**Q2: How do you handle side effects in React?**  
**A2:** Use `useEffect()` for effects like API calls or subscriptions. Return a cleanup function to handle unmounting or dependency changes.

**Q3: What are keys in lists and why are they important?**  
**A3:** Keys help React efficiently re-render lists by identifying which items changed. Use stable, unique IDs, **not** array indices when possible.

---

## ✅ **Top 5 SQL Server / T-SQL Interview Questions (Practical)**

**Q1: How do you optimize a slow SELECT query?**  
**A1:** Use indexes, avoid `SELECT *`, review the execution plan, and use `WHERE`/`TOP` to limit data.

**Q2: What’s the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL JOIN?**  
**A2:**

- `INNER JOIN`: returns matching rows only
    
- `LEFT JOIN`: all rows from the left + matches
    
- `FULL JOIN`: all rows from both, even if no match
    

**Q3: How do you implement transactions in T-SQL?**  
**A3:** Use `BEGIN TRAN`, followed by `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` based on logic.

**Q4: What is a CTE and when would you use it?**  
**A4:** A **Common Table Expression** (CTE) is a temporary result set used for recursive queries or to simplify complex joins and subqueries.

**Q5: How do you handle NULL values in queries?**  
**A5:** Use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` for filtering, and `COALESCE()` or `ISNULL()` for value substitution.

---

**Q6: How do you identify and resolve blocking or deadlocks?**  
**A6:**

- Use `sp_who2`, `sys.dm_exec_requests`, and `sys.dm_tran_locks`

---

**Q10: What are table variables vs. temporary tables?**  
**A10:**

- **Table variables** (`@MyTable`) are in-memory, limited indexing
    
- **Temp tables** (`#MyTemp`) stored in tempdb, support indexes and statistics
    
- Use table variables for small/short-lived data
    

---

**Q11: How do you prevent SQL injection?**  
**A11:**

- Use **parameterized queries** or **stored procedures**

- `DELETE`: logged, supports WHERE, can be rolled back
    
- `TRUNCATE`: faster, removes all rows, minimal logging, cannot be used if FK constraints exist
    

---

**Q14: How can you find duplicate rows in a table?**  
**A14:**

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT Col1, COUNT(*)  FROM TableName GROUP BY Col1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`
