If the new GitHub policy no longer allows username-based authentication,
you'll need to use an alternative method to authenticate and push your changes
to your remote repository. Here are a few options:

**Option 1: Use Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**

You can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your GitHub account
settings. A PAT is a secure token that can be used to authenticate with GitHub
without using your username and password.

To generate a PAT:

  1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to your account settings.
  2. Click on "Developer settings" and then "Personal access tokens".
  3. Click on "Generate new token" and follow the prompts to create a new token.
  4. Name your token, select the required scopes (e.g., "repo"), and click "Generate token".

Once you have your PAT, you can use it to authenticate with GitHub using the
following command:

bash

Copy

    git config --global credential.helper "store --file=~/.git-credentials"
    echo "https://<your-username>:$(your-pat)@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials


The https:// clone URLs are available on all repositories, regardless of visibility. https:// clone URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy.

When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a private remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. 



Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username and `your-pat` with
the PAT you generated.

**Option 2: Use SSH keys**

You can use SSH keys to authenticate with GitHub. This method is more secure
than using PATs, but it requires some additional setup.

To set up SSH keys:

  1. Generate a new SSH key pair using a tool like `ssh-keygen` (on Linux/Mac) or PuTTYgen (on Windows).
  2. Add the public key to your GitHub account settings under "SSH and GPG keys".
  3. Copy the private key to the `.ssh` directory in your Git repository (e.g., `~/.ssh`).

Once you have set up your SSH keys, you can use the following command to
authenticate with GitHub:

bash

Copy

    ssh -T git@github.com

This command will prompt you to enter your passphrase (if you have one).

**Option 3: Use GitHub CLI**

You can use the GitHub CLI to authenticate with GitHub using your username and
password (or a PAT). This method is more convenient than the other two
options, but it requires you to have the GitHub CLI installed on your system.

To authenticate with GitHub CLI:

  1. Install the GitHub CLI if you haven't already.
  2. Run the following command to authenticate:

bash

Copy

    gh auth login

Follow the prompts to enter your username and password (or PAT).

Once you've authenticated, you can use the GitHub CLI to push your changes to
your remote repository:

bash

Copy

    gh push

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
